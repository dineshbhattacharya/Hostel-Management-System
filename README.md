# üè® Hostel Management System

## üß† Description

This project is a **comprehensive Hostel Management System** developed using **C** for the application logic and **MySQL** for backend data management. It is designed to streamline and automate hostel operations for institutions managing large student populations.

The system provides **role-based access control** to differentiate between student, staff, and admin users. It manages a variety of hostel-related tasks including student registration, staff records, inventory tracking, and monthly expense automation. The MySQL database is **fully normalized**, ensuring efficient data storage and faster queries.

Designed for scalability, the system currently supports 500+ students and significantly reduces manual workload with automated tracking and reporting.
